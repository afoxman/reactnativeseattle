# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of professional experience, education, socio-economic status, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all people who participate in the React Native Seattle community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Conduct

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. This includes public _and_ private venues, in person or online. It also applies to aliases, nicknames, avatars.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
- Respect that people will have differences of opinion, and that there is seldom a "right" answer.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

If you feel you have been harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the "core team" members on Discord or send mail to [conduct@reactnativeseattle.com](mailto:conduct@reactnativeseattle.com) immediately. Whether you’re an established member or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct online. If you feel that a thread on Discord needs moderation, please contact a member of the "core team".

- Remarks that violate this code of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed.
- Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in this code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
- Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
- If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., removed from the communication channel to cool off.
- If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
- If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
- Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the React Native Seattle community, we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.
