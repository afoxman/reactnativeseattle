# React Native Seattle

Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! Welcome to the React Native Seattle community!

We are a diverse group of people, and all are welcome, regardless of skill level or experience. If you live in the area and have an interest in React Native, please join us!

We host free, in-person events periodically. Youâ€™ll meet people, make connections, share technology & ideas, and learn.

Between meetups, you can find the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Yh4uhUbKj6). We also post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RNSeattle).

We expect everyone to follow our [Code of Conduct](./conduct.html) online and at events.
